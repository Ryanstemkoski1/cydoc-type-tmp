# Types Repo for Cydoc Ecosystme

We'll store our shared types for the Cydoc ecosystem here.

# Development

Install dependencies with `npm install`

All code written in Typescript, types in `index.js` will be published

# Usage

These types are *private* so you'll need a valid github access token for the types repo in your environment (NPM_TOKEN)

If you have access to the repo, follow instructions to put an access token in your environment.
I added mine to my `.zshrc` but your setup may be different.

# Deployment

These types are *private* so you'll need an access token with publishing capability for this specific repo.
